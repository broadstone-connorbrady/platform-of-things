### Intro
Hopefully this project should have been picked up and deployed finally.

### What's going on
- University exams coming up. Only 2 as the modules are staggered for each year
- AWMS Project is going smoothly. We're mostly building the front end with the back end.
- Picking up a project with a fair bit of tech debt + bugs. E.g a tick box returning 25,000 rows of data

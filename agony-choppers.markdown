#### How do I learn a new programming language?
If you're experienced at programming, then you can probably pick another one up fairly easily (Exceptions apply: C, ASM,
and Java if you're into getting hit with NPEs every 2 minutes)

On the other hand if you're just starting out, sorry to say but learning a programming language is boring. There is nothing more
monotonous than going through YouTube tutorials in the following order

- About programming language X
- Getting started
- Making our program run
- Hello world!
- Maths
- etc...

You get the point. Back when I was 9, I first started dabbling around with scripting in LUA for a game I was playing and 
managed to get pretty far with it. When trying to learn more LUA outside the game I was playing, eventually I got bored 
and went playing out instead. 

Point being: if you're going to learn a language, apply it to something. Like trains? Make some sort of signaling system or 
timetable system. Like cars? Make a parts picker. You'll find being able to learn all this Matrix stuff a lot easier if you pretend like
you're actually in a business environment. It moves from being a chore to actually being quite fun. That's one of the main things that 
attracts me to programming: watching your little system grow into something bigger.

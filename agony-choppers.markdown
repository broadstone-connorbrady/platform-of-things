#### Your Github commit history is insane. Is it legit?
100%. Since I started studying my degree, a lot of my code and assignments are posted onto Github. Also I do a fair bit 
code wise throughout a normal working day.

Even on Christmas Day 2020, I was up early in the morning trying to upgrade Lumen and do performance fixes. Kind of happens when 
your hobby is also your job

#### How to avoid burnout?
Stop programming. Go on a walk; meet up with friends; drink a little; drink a lot and get plastered (Totally not talking from experience). 
Either way keeping away from the screen will keep you sane. If you find you're just getting tired of the feature you're currently on, 
I normally do something therapeutic for my company such as 

- Code cleanups
- Reviews
- Write documentation

Quick and easy tasks that you often feel good for doing.

TL;DR - Get away from the screen, or if you can't do that at least play a game (Holdfast being a particular favourite of mine at the moment).

#### How do I learn a new programming language?
If you're experienced at programming, then you can probably pick another one up fairly easily (Exceptions apply: C, ASM,
and Java if you're into getting hit with NPEs every 2 minutes)

On the other hand if you're just starting out, sorry to say but learning a programming language is boring. There is nothing more
monotonous than going through YouTube tutorials in the following order

- About programming language X
- Getting started
- Making our program run
- Hello world!
- Maths
- etc...

You get the point. Back when I was 9, I first started dabbling around with scripting in LUA for a game I was playing and 
managed to get pretty far with it. When trying to learn more LUA outside the game I was playing, eventually I got bored 
and went playing out instead. 

Point being: if you're going to learn a language, apply it to something. Like trains? Make some sort of signaling system or 
timetable system. Like cars? Make a parts picker. You'll find being able to learn all this Matrix stuff a lot easier if you pretend like
you're actually in a business environment. It moves from being a chore to actually being quite fun. That's one of the main things that 
attracts me to programming: watching your little system grow into something bigger.

Oh, take regular breaks too, unless you're really enjoying. In that case, keep at it

Also don't be afraid to write crap code. There's a saying that goes "You can't make good crops without fertilizer"

Don't worry too much about the fancy words too. Learning the theory is great, but they'll make a lot of sense as you use them.

As for some direction, some basic high-level programming/scripting languages to kick yourself off with could be:

- Javascript
- Python
- LUA

FYI don't Google `BASIC Programming Language` Or you'll be going back right back to the 80s

Also try not to do what I did and learn Java as my first Object Orientated language. Jesus Christ, writing bad code in Java soon 
bites you in the form of memory leaks and NPEs

Hi, this site will probably contain some rants, findings, and any updates on anything that is going on.

Nothing on this site is going to be 100% accurate and there'll be grammar/spelling mistakes somewhere. 

Hosted on: GCP Cloud Storage (I'm way too tight to pay for storage)

Site built with: Jekyll

CI: Github actions

If you spot anything or have questions, leave on issue on the project for this site
